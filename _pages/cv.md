My name is Mike Langen and I am currently an economist at the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (CPB). Before I was an assistant professor at the University of Reading and Postdoc at the National University of Singapore. I am interested in real estate economics and finance, paired with all sorts of data science and machine learning. Since my PhD I am working on projects at the intersection of the two, trying to overcome market inefficiencies. My goal is to constantly learn and develop in these areas. 

I am holding a PhD in real estate finance and MSc in financial economics, both from Maastricht University.
